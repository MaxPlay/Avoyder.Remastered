# Avoyder.Remastered
A remaster of a game a few friends and I made back in our finals years at school.

## Installation
There is still no build available, because this project is in its earliest stages. You can build it yourself by using the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Development
The game is developed using MonoGame and should run on any desktop platform.

Just pull from master and open the Solution file. This project is developed in [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) and I recommend using it as well. You can also use Visual Studio Code, but it is not my working environment, so any commits that contain VSCode artifacts will get rejected.

## Roadmap
Still working on it :)
